## Documentation

### Rules and guidelines

- **Redux**  
  Each entity should have a separate folder. In each folder, different files are needed for actions and reducers:
  - `{modelName}.actions.js`
  - `{modelName}.reducer.js`

- **Configuration**  
  Configuration is done via the `.env` file where environment variables are located.

- **Styles**  
  For styling, use `StyleSheet.create()` from `react-native` and ensure styles are encapsulated within the specific component.

- **Components**  
  - Components connected to Redux should be located in the `containers` folder.
  - Components without a Redux connection should be in the `components` folder.
  - Pages accessible via routing (using `react-navigation`) should be in the `pages` folder. All components used on a page should reside in that page's specific folder.
  
  Each component should have at least two files:
  - `index.js` main file with all logic
  - `{component-name}.styles.js` where styles are stored

### Testing

#### Components

Order of testing:

1. Stateless components used across multiple places.
2. Components depending on other components but not connected to Redux and without state.
3. Components with internal state but not connected to Redux.
4. Components connected to Redux.

##### What to test:

- **Properties**: default properties, custom properties, and data types (use `jest-extended`).
- **Conditions**: test behavior under different conditions.
- **State**: default state and how state changes based on events.
- **Events**: test events with and without parameters.

##### How to test:

- Test snapshots to compare UI changes.
- Test the component's logic, especially dynamic behaviors.

##### Donâ€™t test:

- Third-party libraries
- Constants
- Static styles
